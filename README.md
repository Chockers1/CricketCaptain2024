# Cricket Captain Stat Pack

Streamlit-powered analytics suite for Cricket Captain 2025 saves. Upload thousands of scorecards, slice performance by format or competition, and explore rich visual dashboards designed for serious stat-heads.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or newer
- `pip` (or `pipenv`/`uv` if you prefer)
- A subscription to the **Cricket Captain 2024 Stats Pack** (credentials are required to log in)

## üì• Uploading Scorecards

1. **Gather scorecards**
   - Windows: `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\Childish Things\Cricket Captain 2025\Saves\Scorecards`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Containers/com.childishthings.cricketcaptain2025mac/Data/Library/Application Support/Cricket Captain 2025/childish things/cricket captain 2025/saves`
2. **Choose an import mode**
   - *ZIP mode* (recommended for large archives): compress the folder, upload once, and the app flattens nested directories automatically.
   - *TXT mode*: select individual `.txt` files for smaller batches.
3. Hit **Process Scorecards**. The pipeline reads every file, standardises competition names, stores match/game/batting/bowling extracts, and caches the results in session state.

Progress feedback appears as each stage (match, game, bowling, batting) completes. Duplicate detection, player team switches, and innings overlap checks run automatically.

## üîß Under the Hood

The ingestion scripts inside the project root orchestrate the data model:

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `match.py` | Extracts match metadata, detects results/outcomes, and normalises competition names (trophies, league phases, international titles). |
| `game.py` | Captures innings totals, run rates, wickets, overs, and merges match context. |
| `bat.py` | Parses every batting line, calculates milestones, strike rates, dismissal types, and maps competitions using the latest naming rules. |
| `bowl.py` | Processes bowling figures, computes advanced metrics (dot percentage, economy, strike rate), and aligns competition labels with batting/match data. |
| `cricketcaptain.py` | Streamlit entry-point handling authentication, navigation, and session lifetime. |

Processed DataFrames (`match_data.csv`, `game_data.csv`, `bat_df`, `bowl_df`) persist in memory during a session and can be exported if you extend the app.
